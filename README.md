# uSync8
Database syncing tool for Umbraco 8 

## Very alpha
This repo is full of very alpha code, while i work out the architecture of uSync for Umbraco 8 - 

Here we are just investigating the possiblities 
and working out if we can take advantage of Umbraco 8 features to make uSync work even betterer

it might be that the live version is eventually a fork from the current uSync version for umbraco 7. 

Pop into the issues to see if you can help us make some choices about how uSync works.
